Formula Student Driverless Path Planning Algorithm

This repository contains the path planning algorithm developed by FaSTTUBe for the 2021/22 Formula Student season.

List of contributors:

- Panagiotis Karagiannis
- Albert Thelemann

The intention of this repository is to provide teams entering the driverless category with a path planning algorithm, so that they can get up and running as fast as possible. Teams are encouraged to use this repository as a basis and adapt it to their own pipeline, as well as make changes that will improve the algorithms performance.

The code is not available yet. The plan is for it to be made available between September and October 2022.

The codebase is written entirely in Python and makes heavy use of NumPy, SciPy, and Numba.
